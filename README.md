I am Ankita Pattanaik pursuing my Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering(Core).
Here I have attached two projects that were part of my web development internship under Bharat intern.
The task 1 has the code of a portfolio web page of a Web Developer that is coded in languages like HTML and CSS.
The task 3 has the code of a clone of welcome page of Netflix that is coded in languages like HTML and CSS.
